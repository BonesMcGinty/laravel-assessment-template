# Laravel Assessment

## PHP Movies

### Requirements
Styling of any HTML created is not required, but feel free to do so if you'd like.

The application should:

- Seed a database with at least 5 actors and at least 3 movies per actor
- Use Eloquent to define the relationship between actors and movies
- Have a view that displays the list of actors and their associated movies
- Also include one input that allows the list of actors to be filtered. This can either be done with just PHP or with JavaScript, whichever you prefer. We're just looking for the end result.
- Have a view with one input that allows the user to search people via the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/documentation#people) and then displays the data.
  - The API call should be done on the back end.

*We're really looking for clean code and general best practices here. Nothing fancy is required.*
